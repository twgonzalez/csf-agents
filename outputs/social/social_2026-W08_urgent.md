## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 202/280*

AB1751 guts local zoning. Any residential parcel. Townhomes approved by state mandate — no hearings, no CEQA, no impact fees. Your city pays the infrastructure bill. Oppose it now. #LocalControl #AB1751

AB1751 — the Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act — sounds reasonable. It isn't.

This bill creates a statewide ministerial pathway that forces cities to approve townhome development on any residential parcel. No discretionary review. No public hearings. No CEQA. If a project meets state objective standards, your city must say yes — regardless of neighborhood character, infrastructure capacity, or your community's own planning vision.

That's preemption. And it gets worse.

AB1751 eliminates cities' authority to charge impact fees for new townhome residents. Water. Sewer. Traffic. Schools. The costs of serving new development shift entirely to people who already live there — your taxpayers fund growth they had no voice in approving.

This isn't a housing bill. It's a transfer of power — from the communities closest to these decisions to Sacramento.

We're formally opposing AB1751 and coordinating with planning directors across the state to document what this bill actually costs. If you're a city official, advocate, or concerned resident, we need your voice.

Contact your Assembly member today and tell them to oppose AB1751. Local communities — not state mandates — should decide how neighborhoods grow.

AB1751 would force cities to approve townhomes on any residential parcel — no hearings, no CEQA review, no community input. Just a state mandate your city cannot refuse.

And when those new residents need water, sewer, roads, and schools? Cities can't charge impact fees. Your neighbors — the ones already here — pick up the tab.

This is what preemption looks like in practice. Sacramento overrides your planning commission, your city council, and your voice. We're fighting AB1751. Stand with us.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

### X
*✓ 229/280*

AB2288 forces residential conversions in industrial zones — no developer-funded infrastructure required. Jobs land gone. Contaminated sites approved ministerially. Call your Assembly member. Oppose this now. #LocalControl #AB2288

---

### Facebook

No hearing this week — but AB2288 is moving and your Assembly member needs to hear from you now.

AB2288 forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrially zoned areas. That sounds like flexibility. Here's what it actually means:

Industrial zones were designated for jobs — manufacturing, warehousing, businesses that generate tax revenue and employment. Converting them to housing is a one-way door. Once that land is gone, it's gone.

Worse: industrial zones aren't built for people to live in. They lack residential water and sewer infrastructure, parks, and pedestrian safety features. AB2288 lets developers convert these sites without funding the upgrades residents would need. Cities cannot require it. Taxpayers absorb the cost.

And because conversions proceed ministerially, contamination history and incompatible neighboring industrial operations don't trigger local environmental review. Families could end up in homes built on sites cities never had the chance to scrutinize.

This is the same playbook as AB1751 — strip local authority, mandate state approval, shift costs to existing residents.

Your ask is simple: call your Assembly member this week and tell them to oppose AB2288. Let them know your city has employment land protections for a reason — and Sacramento shouldn't be able to erase them.

AB2288 forces cities to allow housing conversions in industrial zones — even on contaminated sites, even without developer-funded infrastructure, even over your city's economic development plans.

Once that jobs land converts to residential, it doesn't come back. Tax revenue, manufacturing capacity, local employment — gone. And cities can't require developers to pay for the water, sewer, or safety upgrades residents would actually need.

Your Assembly member is hearing from developers. Make sure they hear from you. Call them this week and oppose AB2288.

AB1751. AB2288. SB1014. Three bills. One pattern: Sacramento takes the decision. Your city pays the cost. Existing residents fund growth they never approved. This is the fight. #LocalControl #CaliforniaHousing

### Facebook

Look at this week's bills side by side and you'll see a pattern that goes far beyond any single piece of legislation.

AB1751 mandates townhome approvals on any residential parcel — no hearings, no impact fees, no community input. AB2288 forces residential conversions into industrial zones cities spent decades protecting for jobs and tax revenue. SB1014 restricts cities from requiring that new development fund its own traffic, utility, and safety impacts.

Three different bills. Three different authors. One consistent outcome: the people closest to these decisions — city councils, planning commissions, neighborhood advocates, the residents who will live with the consequences — are removed from the process. Sacramento decides. Your community pays.

The Supreme Court just denied Huntington Beach's appeal in its fight over local housing authority. Local leaders in Michigan are gathering to push back on state zoning preemption. This isn't a California quirk — it's a national erosion of the principle that the best decisions are made by the people closest to them.

The California Stewardship Fund exists because that principle is worth defending. Not just bill by bill, but as a coherent commitment to the idea that local government is not an obstacle to good outcomes — it IS the mechanism for good outcomes.

We'll keep tracking, documenting, and fighting. We're glad you're with us.

Three bills this week. One pattern.

AB1751 strips zoning authority and bans impact fees for townhomes. AB2288 forces industrial land into residential use with no developer-funded infrastructure. SB1014 prevents cities from requiring that new growth pay for its own impacts. Different bills, same result: Sacramento decides, communities pay, and the people closest to these decisions are cut out of the process.

This isn't about being anti-housing. It's about who decides — and whether local government still means anything. The California Stewardship Fund believes it does. That's the fight we're in, and it doesn't stop at the state line.
