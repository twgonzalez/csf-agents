## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 195/280*

AB1751 preempts local zoning statewide — townhomes on any residential parcel, no discretionary review, no impact fees. Your city pays the infrastructure bill. Call your rep. #LocalControl #AB1751

AB1751 — the Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act — is one of the most sweeping local zoning preemptions introduced this session. Here's what it actually does.

Under AB1751, townhome development becomes a state-mandated ministerial right on any residential parcel in California. That means your city council loses all discretionary authority over these projects. If a proposal meets state objective standards, it must be approved — regardless of neighborhood infrastructure capacity, service levels, or local planning priorities.

Design review is eliminated. Public hearings don't apply. CEQA review is waived.

And then there's the cost: AB1751 prohibits cities from collecting water, sewer, traffic, or school impact fees from new townhome residents. Every infrastructure cost those new residents generate — roads, pipes, schools, parks — shifts directly to existing taxpayers.

This isn't about whether townhomes get built. It's about who decides where, how, and who pays. AB1751 removes that authority from your city council and hands it to Sacramento.

Contact your Assembly member now. Ask them to oppose AB1751 and protect your community's right to plan its own future.

AB1751 would make townhome development a state-mandated right on any residential parcel — no local discretionary review, no public hearings, no CEQA.

Your city council couldn't say no. And your city couldn't charge a single dollar in impact fees — no water, sewer, traffic, or school fees — shifting every infrastructure cost to existing residents and the general fund.

This isn't about stopping housing. It's about who decides. AB1751 removes that answer from your community entirely.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

*✓ 225/280*

AB2288 forces residential conversions in industrial zones — preempting employment land protections cities built through local planning. No developer infrastructure funding required. Contact your rep now. #AB2288 #LocalControl

Action Alert: AB2288 needs your attention — and your voice.

AB2288 forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrially zoned areas, directly preempting the employment land protections your community established through years of local planning.

This is a two-sided problem. First, it removes a city's authority to preserve industrial land for job-generating uses — the tax base that funds city services. Once that land converts to residential, it doesn't convert back. Second, industrial zones weren't built for people to live in. They lack residential water and sewer infrastructure, sidewalks, parks, and safe pedestrian connections. AB2288 prohibits cities from requiring developers to fund those upgrades. Existing residents pay instead.

There are also real environmental concerns: conversions proceed ministerially even on sites with contamination history or adjacent industrial operations that are incompatible with residential use — with no local environmental review.

Who decides whether your city's industrial land gets converted to housing — your city council, or Sacramento?

Contact your Assembly member today. Urge them to oppose AB2288 and protect your community's economic and planning authority.

AB2288 would force your city to allow residential conversions in industrial zones — overriding the employment land protections your community chose through local planning.

Industrial zones weren't built for residents. They lack the water, sewer, sidewalks, and parks that livable housing requires. AB2288 prohibits cities from requiring developers to fund those upgrades. That cost falls on existing taxpayers — not the projects generating the need.

Once industrial land converts, it doesn't come back. The jobs, the tax base, and the city's economic strategy go with it. Your city council should make that call — not Sacramento.

AB1751 kills impact fees. AB2288 converts industrial land. SB1014 limits offsite improvements. The pattern: strip local authority, shift costs to residents. Who decides? Not your city council. #LocalControl

Look at this week's bills together and the pattern is unmistakable.

AB1751 creates a statewide ministerial pathway for townhomes, eliminates discretionary review, and strips cities of impact fee authority. AB2288 forces residential conversions in industrial zones, preempting employment land protections and prohibiting cities from requiring infrastructure upgrades. SB1014 restricts cities' ability to require offsite infrastructure improvements as development conditions, shifting growth-related costs to existing residents.

Three different bills. Three different mechanisms. One consistent outcome: the authority to plan, condition, and fund local infrastructure moves from city halls to Sacramento — and the costs move to the people who already live there.

This is the strategic moment. Sacramento is not passing one sweeping preemption bill. It is advancing a layered series of targeted restrictions — on fees, on zoning, on conditions, on land use — that collectively dismantle local planning authority piece by piece.

The California Stewardship Fund exists precisely for this moment: to make the pattern visible, to equip city councils and advocates with the arguments, and to ensure that the question 'who decides?' gets answered by the communities closest to the decision — not by the capitol.

We are watching. We are organized. And we are not done.

Three bills. Three mechanisms. One pattern.

AB1751 eliminates impact fees and local zoning authority for townhomes. AB2288 forces residential conversions in industrial zones with no developer infrastructure requirements. SB1014 strips cities of their ability to require offsite improvements as development conditions. Each bill, taken alone, looks targeted. Together, they are systematically dismantling local planning authority — shifting both decisions and costs away from the communities that live with the results.

This is the fight. Not one bill, one author, or one session — but a sustained legislative strategy to move the question of 'who decides?' from city hall to Sacramento. The California Stewardship Fund is here to make that pattern visible and keep local authority intact.
