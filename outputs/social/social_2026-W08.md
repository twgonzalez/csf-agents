## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 271/280*

AB1751 forces your city to approve townhomes on any residential parcel—no hearings, no CEQA, no impact fees. Water, sewer, traffic costs shift to existing taxpayers. Sacramento decides. Your council doesn't. Tell your Assembly member: oppose AB1751. #LocalControl #AB1751

AB1751 — the Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act — sounds reasonable. Read what it actually does.

This bill creates a statewide ministerial pathway for townhome development on any residential parcel in California. That means your city council cannot say no. If a project meets state objective standards, it is approved — automatically — regardless of neighborhood character, infrastructure capacity, or anything your community has planned for.

No design review. No public hearing. No CEQA environmental review.

And here's the part that should make every city finance director and public works director sit up: AB1751 strips cities of all impact fee authority for qualifying developments. No water fees. No sewer fees. No traffic mitigation fees. No school impact fees.

The infrastructure those new residents will use has to be paid for by someone. Under AB1751, that someone is your existing taxpayers.

This isn't about whether townhomes belong in California communities. It's about who decides where, how, and at whose expense. AB1751 answers that question: Sacramento decides. Your city council doesn't get a vote.

Contact your Assembly member today. Ask them directly: will you oppose AB1751? Find your rep at assembly.ca.gov.

AB1751 forces your city to approve townhomes on any residential parcel in California — no public hearing, no environmental review, no discretionary authority whatsoever. If a project meets state standards, approval is automatic. Your council is cut out entirely.

The infrastructure cost piece is just as alarming. This bill strips cities of all impact fee authority for these developments. Water, sewer, traffic, schools — those costs don't disappear. They shift directly to your existing taxpayers, who had no say in the project and no vote on the bill.

This is the pattern Sacramento keeps repeating: mandate the development, eliminate local review, and hand the bill to the people already living there. AB1751 is one of the most sweeping versions yet. Your Assembly member needs to hear from you now.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

### X
*✓ 267/280*

AB2288 forces cities to allow housing in industrial zones—then bans cities from requiring developers to fund water, sewer, or parks upgrades. Contaminated sites. Zero infrastructure. Your jobs base gone. Call your Assembly member. Oppose AB2288. #LocalControl #AB2288

---

### Facebook

AB2288 is moving in Sacramento, and most city councils don't know it exists yet. Here's what it does — and why you need to contact your Assembly member today.

This bill forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrial-zoned areas. Your city's employment land protections — the ones your community spent years developing through local planning — are preempted. Once that industrial land converts to residential, it does not come back.

The infrastructure problem is severe. Industrial zones were never built for people to live in. They lack residential water and sewer capacity, parks, pedestrian infrastructure, and basic urban services. AB2288 bans cities from requiring developers to fund the upgrades needed to make those sites livable. Who pays? Your existing residents and your general fund.

And because these conversions proceed ministerially, local environmental review is eliminated — even on sites with contamination histories or incompatible neighboring operations.

Your city's tax base, your jobs strategy, your environmental protections: AB2288 preempts all of it at once.

This week, call your Assembly member. Tell them: AB2288 strips cities of employment land authority, shifts infrastructure costs to taxpayers, and eliminates environmental review on potentially contaminated sites. Ask them to oppose it. Find your rep at assembly.ca.gov.

AB2288 forces your city to allow housing in industrial zones — overriding the employment land protections your community built through years of local planning. Once that land converts to residential, the jobs and tax revenue it supported don't come back.

The infrastructure gap is real and it falls on you. Industrial zones weren't designed for people to live in. AB2288 bans cities from requiring developers to fund the water, sewer, parks, and pedestrian upgrades those new residents will need. Your existing taxpayers absorb the cost. And because conversions are ministerial, there's no local environmental review — even on sites with contamination history.

Your Assembly member needs to hear from constituents this week. Call them and ask directly: will you oppose AB2288? The number is in our bio.

## Post 3 — Mission Frame

### X
*✓ 274/280*

AB1751, AB2288, SB1014—same session, same pattern. Override zoning. Kill impact fees. Shift costs to existing taxpayers. This isn't housing policy. It's a systematic transfer of power from your city to Sacramento. Local officials: we're building the coalition. #LocalControl

---

### Facebook

Three bills. One pattern. And most of the people affected by it don't know it's happening.

AB1751 creates a ministerial pathway for townhomes on any residential parcel and strips cities of all impact fee authority. AB2288 forces housing into industrial zones and bans cities from requiring developers to fund basic residential infrastructure. SB1014 restricts cities' ability to require offsite improvements as development conditions, shifting traffic, utility, and safety costs to existing residents.

These aren't isolated bills. They are a coordinated rewrite of who holds authority over how California communities grow. The mechanism is always the same: remove discretionary review, eliminate city conditioning authority, mandate approval, and make existing taxpayers absorb the costs that new development should fund.

The Supreme Court just declined to hear Huntington Beach's appeal on housing mandates. Local officials across the country — in Michigan, Rhode Island, and here in California — are organizing to push back on state preemption. The moment to build that coalition in California is now, before these bills move out of committee.

The California Stewardship Fund believes the best decisions come from the people closest to them. That's not a slogan — it's the principle this entire fight is about. Your city council, your planning commission, your community: they are the legitimate decision-makers for how your community grows. We intend to keep it that way.

If you're a local official, a planning commissioner, or a donor who believes local accountability matters, reach out. The fight is organized. There is a place for you in it.

AB1751, AB2288, SB1014. Three bills introduced in the same session, each one cutting away at a different piece of local authority. Override the zoning. Kill the impact fees. Restrict the infrastructure conditions. Shift every cost to the people already living there.

This is not an accident. It is a pattern — and it moves fast. Most city council members won't see these bills until they've already cleared committee. The gap between what Sacramento is doing and what local officials know is exactly where these preemptions survive.

Local leaders in Michigan and Rhode Island are organizing right now. The Supreme Court just shut the door on one California city's appeal. The pressure on local control is real and it is escalating. The California Stewardship Fund exists to close that information gap and build the coalition that can hold the line. If that fight matters to you, this is the moment to be in it.
