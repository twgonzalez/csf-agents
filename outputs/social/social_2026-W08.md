## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 212/280*

AB1751 preempts local zoning for townhomes on ANY residential parcel — no public hearing, no CEQA, no impact fees. Your city pays the infrastructure bill. Who decides? Not your city council. #LocalControl #AB1751

AB1751 — the Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act — is one of the most sweeping preemptions of local zoning authority introduced this session. Here's what it actually does.

The bill creates a statewide ministerial pathway allowing townhome development on any residential parcel in California. Projects that meet state objective standards must be approved — full stop. No public hearing. No design review. No CEQA. Your city council has no discretionary authority over what gets built or where.

But the infrastructure provision is what every city manager and public works director needs to read carefully: cities cannot charge water, sewer, traffic, or school impact fees for new townhome residents under this bill. The cost of serving those new residents shifts entirely to existing taxpayers and your city's general fund.

This isn't about stopping housing. It's about who decides how housing gets built, where it goes, and who pays for the roads, pipes, and schools that serve it. AB1751 removes your community from that conversation entirely.

Contact your Assembly member now. Ask them where they stand on AB1751 and whether they support transferring infrastructure costs from developers to your constituents.

AB1751 would create a statewide green light for townhome development on any residential parcel — ministerial approval, no public hearing, no CEQA, no discretionary review.

Here's the part that hits hardest: cities cannot charge impact fees for new townhome residents under this bill. Water. Sewer. Traffic. Schools. Those costs shift to your existing taxpayers — not the developers building the projects.

This isn't about whether housing gets built. It's about who decides how, where, and at whose expense. AB1751 removes local authority from that equation entirely. Contact your Assembly member and ask where they stand.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

### X
*✓ 204/280*

AB2288 forces cities to allow housing in industrial zones — even on contaminated sites — with no local review and no developer funding for residential upgrades. Contact your rep now. #LocalControl #AB2288

### Facebook

No hearings are scheduled this week — but AB2288 is moving, and your Assembly member needs to hear from you before it does.

AB2288 forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrial-zoned areas. That sounds practical until you look at the details.

Industrial zones weren't designed for residents. They lack the water, sewer, pedestrian, and park infrastructure that residential use requires. AB2288 preempts cities' authority to require developers to fund those upgrades. That cost falls on existing residents and your general fund.

There's an economic threat too. Industrial land is a finite, non-renewable asset for cities. Once it's converted to housing, it doesn't come back. The tax-generating employment uses those zones support — the jobs, the supply chains, the local economic base — disappear permanently.

And in a detail that should concern every planning commissioner: the bill allows conversions to proceed ministerially even on sites with contamination history or adjacent to operations that are incompatible with residential use. No local environmental review required.

Call or email your Assembly member this week. Tell them AB2288 preempts local authority over employment land and shifts infrastructure costs to taxpayers. Ask them to oppose it.

AB2288 forces cities to approve residential conversions in industrial zones — even on sites with contamination history or next to operations incompatible with housing.

Cities cannot require developers to fund the water, sewer, pedestrian, or parks infrastructure those conversions need. That cost lands on existing residents. And once industrial land converts to housing, it's gone — the jobs and tax base those zones support don't come back.

This is infrastructure cost-shifting and employment land preemption packaged as a housing solution. Contact your Assembly member this week and ask them to oppose AB2288.

AB1751. AB2288. SB1014. Three bills, one pattern: Sacramento decides what gets built, where, and who pays. California's housing debate isn't about housing anymore. It's about who governs. #LocalControl #CALeg

Look at what's moving in Sacramento this session and a clear pattern emerges.

AB1751 mandates townhome approvals on any residential parcel and strips cities of all impact fee authority. AB2288 forces residential conversions onto industrial land with no requirement that developers fund the necessary infrastructure. SB1014 restricts cities from requiring new development to fund its own offsite traffic, utility, and safety improvements.

Three different bills. Three different authors. One consistent outcome: the costs of growth shift from developers to existing residents, and the decisions shift from your city council to Sacramento.

The Supreme Court's denial of Huntington Beach's appeal this week is a reminder that the legal path back to local authority is narrow. The legislative path is where this fight is won or lost.

The California Stewardship Fund's position isn't that housing shouldn't be built. It's that the people closest to these decisions — elected locally, accountable locally — are best positioned to make them. When Sacramento preempts that authority, communities lose more than zoning control. They lose the ability to plan for infrastructure, protect their economic base, and hold someone accountable when things go wrong.

That's the fight. We're in it.

AB1751 strips impact fee authority and removes all discretionary review for townhomes. AB2288 forces industrial land into residential use with no developer infrastructure obligations. SB1014 prevents cities from requiring new development to fund its own offsite impacts.

Three bills. One direction: growth costs shift to existing residents, and decisions shift from your city council to Sacramento. This week's Supreme Court ruling against Huntington Beach confirms the legal window is narrow — the legislative fight is where local authority is defended or surrendered.

The question was never whether California needs housing. It's who decides how it's built, where it goes, and who pays for what it requires. We believe the answer is the people closest to those decisions — and we're not done making that case.
