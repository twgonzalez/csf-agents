## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 240/280*

AB1751 lets developers build townhomes on any residential parcel in CA — no public hearing, no CEQA, no impact fees. Your city pays the water, sewer & traffic costs. Sacramento decides. Call your Assembly member today. #LocalControl #AB1751

### Facebook

AB1751 — the "Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act" — sounds reasonable. Here's what it actually does.

It creates a statewide ministerial pathway for townhome development on any residential parcel in California. That means: if a project meets Sacramento's objective standards, your city must approve it. No public hearing. No design review. No CEQA. No local discretion whatsoever.

But the part that should alarm every city council member and taxpayer is this: AB1751 strips cities of all impact fee authority for qualifying projects. Your city cannot charge water, sewer, traffic, or school impact fees for new townhome residents.

Somebody still pays for that infrastructure. It's your existing taxpayers.

This isn't about whether townhomes are good or bad. It's about who funds the roads, pipes, and schools that serve them. AB1751 answers that question clearly: not the developer, not the new residents — the people who are already there.

AB1751 was introduced by Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva on February 9. It has no scheduled hearing yet, which means right now is the moment to act before it builds momentum.

Contact your Assembly member today. Ask them directly: will you oppose AB1751? Your community deserves an answer.

### Instagram

AB1751 forces your city to approve townhome development on any residential parcel — no public hearing, no design review, no CEQA. If the project meets Sacramento's checklist, it gets built. Your council has no say.

Here's the part that hits your wallet: AB1751 bans cities from collecting water, sewer, traffic, or school impact fees from new townhome residents. The infrastructure still has to get paid for. That cost shifts entirely to the people already living there — existing taxpayers, not the developers who profit.

This is the pattern Sacramento keeps repeating: mandate development, remove local accountability, hand the bill to your community. AB1751 is the clearest version yet. Find your Assembly member and ask them where they stand.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

### X
*✓ 242/280*

AB2288 forces cities to allow homes in industrial zones — no developer funding for water, sewer, or parks. Jobs land lost forever. No hearings yet: now is the time. Call your Assembly member. Ask: will you oppose AB2288? #LocalControl #AB2288

---

### Facebook

AB2288 is moving quietly — and that's exactly when it's most dangerous.

Introduced February 19 by Assemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva, AB2288 forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrial-zoned areas. That sounds like creative housing policy. Here's the reality.

Industrial zones exist because your community planned for them — for jobs, tax revenue, and economic stability. AB2288 overrides those decisions. Once industrial land converts to residential, it doesn't convert back. That's a permanent loss of employment land and the tax base that funds city services.

Worse: industrial zones aren't built for people to live in. They lack residential water and sewer infrastructure, parks, and pedestrian safety features. Under AB2288, cities cannot require developers to fund those upgrades. Your city's general fund absorbs the cost.

And there's no local environmental review. Conversions proceed ministerially — even on sites with contamination history or industrial neighbors that make residential use genuinely hazardous.

No hearings are scheduled yet. That means this week is your window to get on record before the bill gains momentum in committee.

Contact your Assembly member now. Tell them you oppose AB2288. Ask them to protect your city's employment land and require developers to fund the infrastructure their projects need.

AB2288 forces cities to convert industrial land to residential — permanently. Once that employment land is gone, it's gone. The jobs, the tax base, the economic planning your community spent years building: overridden by Sacramento.

Industrial zones weren't built for people to live in. They don't have the water lines, sewer capacity, parks, or safe sidewalks that residential neighborhoods need. AB2288 doesn't require developers to fund those upgrades. Your city absorbs the cost — and does it without any local environmental review, even on sites with contamination history.

No hearings are scheduled yet. This is the moment to act. Find your Assembly member and tell them to oppose AB2288 before it gets a committee date.

## Post 3 — Mission Frame

*✓ 253/280*

AB1751. AB2288. SB1014. Three bills. Same pattern: Sacramento mandates development, strips local review, hands the infrastructure bill to your taxpayers. The Supreme Court just shut Huntington Beach out. The fight moves to the legislature. #LocalControl

### Facebook

This week, three separate Sacramento bills moved to do the same thing three different ways.

AB1751 removes cities' authority to review or condition townhome development — and bans impact fees so existing taxpayers fund the infrastructure. AB2288 forces residential use into industrial zones, eliminating employment land protections communities built through years of local planning. SB1014 restricts cities from requiring developers to fund offsite traffic, utility, and safety improvements their projects make necessary.

Three bills. One pattern. Sacramento mandates the development. Sacramento removes local review. And Sacramento leaves the infrastructure bill with your residents.

This week also brought news that the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Huntington Beach's challenge to state housing mandates. The courts are not going to draw this line. That means the legislature is the arena — and the people who show up there, speak in hearings, and hold their Assembly members accountable are the ones who determine what happens to California communities.

This is not a fight against housing. It is a fight for the principle that the people closest to a decision should have a voice in it — that your city council, your planning commission, and your neighbors should not be cut out of choices that reshape your streets, your infrastructure, and your tax burden.

That fight is happening right now. Your voice in it matters more than you may think. Follow CSF for specific actions each week.

AB1751 strips cities of zoning authority and impact fee collection. AB2288 forces industrial land into residential use with no developer accountability for infrastructure. SB1014 prevents cities from requiring developers to fund the traffic and utility impacts they create. Three bills, introduced in the same week, executing the same playbook.

Sacramento mandates the development. Sacramento eliminates local review. Sacramento leaves the bill with your taxpayers. This week the Supreme Court also declined to intervene in Huntington Beach's fight against state housing mandates. The courts have stepped back. The legislature is the arena now.

This isn't about stopping housing — it's about who decides how communities grow, and who pays when growth outpaces the infrastructure to support it. That question is being answered in Sacramento right now, with or without your community's input. CSF is tracking every bill and building the case. Stay with us — and bring your council member along.

> A minimal, bold graphic on a deep navy blue background. Three parallel warm gold horizontal bars or lines of slightly varying thickness are stacked in the lower third of the frame, conveying repetition and pattern. The overall feel is stark, authoritative, and clean — suited to policy advocacy communications. Strong contrast between the navy background and the gold accent elements. No text. No typography. No people. No logos.
