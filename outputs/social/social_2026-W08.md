## Post 1 — Bill Spotlight: AB1751

### X
*✓ 206/280*

AB1751 forces your city to approve townhomes on any residential lot — no hearings, no CEQA, no impact fees. Existing taxpayers fund the infrastructure. Call your Assembly member today. #LocalControl #AB1751

AB1751 — the Missing Middle Townhome Ownership Act — does something your city council needs to know about right now.

It creates a statewide ministerial pathway for townhome development on any residential parcel in California. That means: if a project meets state objective standards, your city must approve it. No public hearings. No design review. No CEQA environmental review. No discretionary authority whatsoever.

But the part that should alarm every city official and taxpayer isn't just the zoning preemption. It's the fee ban.

AB1751 strips cities of the authority to charge water, sewer, traffic, or school impact fees for new townhome residents. Those infrastructure costs don't disappear — they shift entirely to your existing taxpayers and your city's general fund. Growth stops paying for growth. You pay instead.

This bill sets a direct precedent for further ministerial preemption of residential zoning across the state. Once this pathway exists, it expands.

Your Assembly member needs to hear from you. Call their office this week and ask them directly: do you support stripping cities of impact fee authority under AB1751? Make them answer.

AB1751 forces your city to approve townhomes on any residential lot — and bans your city from charging a single dollar in impact fees to cover the cost.

No public hearings. No design review. No CEQA. No discretionary review of any kind. If the project meets state standards, approval is mandatory. Your community's infrastructure capacity, neighborhood character, and local planning don't factor in.

Water. Sewer. Traffic. Schools. All of it gets funded by your existing taxpayers — not the new development that created the demand. That's not housing policy. That's a cost transfer.

## Post 2 — Action Alert: AB2288

### X
*✓ 199/280*

AB2288 forces cities to allow housing in industrial zones — and bars them from requiring developers to pay for water, sewer, or parks. Jobs land gone. Costs land on you. Contact your rep now. #AB2288

---

### Facebook

No hearings are scheduled this week — but AB2288 is moving, and your Assembly member needs to hear from you before it does.

AB2288 forces cities to allow residential conversions in industrial-zoned areas. That sounds unremarkable until you understand what it actually strips away.

First: your city loses authority over employment land. Industrial zones are where cities generate tax revenue, protect jobs, and build economic resilience. AB2288 makes those decisions in Sacramento, not at your city council.

Second: industrial sites aren't built for people to live in. They lack residential water and sewer infrastructure, sidewalks, parks, and buffers from incompatible neighboring operations. AB2288 bars cities from requiring developers to fund those upgrades. Your existing residents pay instead — or the housing gets built without them.

Third: there's no local environmental review. Conversions proceed on a ministerial basis even on sites with contamination history or active industrial neighbors.

This is a one-way door. Once employment land converts to residential, it doesn't come back.

Call your Assembly member this week. Tell them AB2288 removes cities' authority to protect jobs, infrastructure, and residents — and ask them to oppose it.

AB2288 forces your city to allow housing in industrial zones — and bars cities from requiring developers to fund the infrastructure needed to make those sites livable.

No residential water lines. No sewer capacity. No parks. No pedestrian infrastructure. No review of contamination history. Cities can't require developers to pay for any of it. Existing taxpayers absorb the gap — or residents move in without it.

And the jobs that industrial land supports? Gone. That land doesn't come back once it converts. Your city's economic base gets decided in Sacramento, not at your city council.

Contact your Assembly member today and ask them to oppose AB2288.

## Post 3 — Mission Frame

*✓ 224/280*

AB1751. AB2288. SB1014. Three bills. Same move: strip cities of authority, shift costs to taxpayers, decide in Sacramento. The Supreme Court just told Huntington Beach: fight in the legislature. So let's fight. #LocalControl

---

### Facebook

This week the U.S. Supreme Court denied Huntington Beach's appeal in its fight to preserve local control over housing mandates. The court's message was clear: this fight happens in the legislature, not the courts.

Look at what's moving in that legislature right now.

AB1751 eliminates all discretionary review for townhomes and bans cities from charging impact fees. AB2288 forces residential conversion of industrial land and bars cities from requiring developers to fund the infrastructure. SB1014 restricts cities from requiring offsite improvements that new development directly creates the need for.

These aren't isolated bills. They are a sustained, coordinated transfer of authority — from city councils to Sacramento, and from developers to existing taxpayers. The mechanism changes bill by bill. The direction never does.

The California Stewardship Fund exists because this pattern has a name, and that name matters: preemption. Not housing policy. Not planning reform. Preemption — the systematic removal of the authority your community earned through local elections and local planning.

The fight is not anti-housing. It is about who decides. It is about whether the people closest to a community's infrastructure, schools, and neighborhoods have any say in how that community grows.

They should. We're making sure they do. Stay engaged — the legislature is moving fast and local voices are exactly what's needed right now.

The Supreme Court just told Huntington Beach it can't win this fight in the courts. It has to be won in the legislature.

This week alone: AB1751 strips cities of zoning authority and bans impact fees. AB2288 eliminates employment land protections and shifts infrastructure costs to existing residents. SB1014 prevents cities from requiring new development to fund its own traffic and utility impacts. Three bills. Same direction. Local authority out. Sacramento in. Costs onto taxpayers.

This is what preemption looks like in practice — not one dramatic moment, but a steady accumulation of bills that each remove one more tool from your city's hands. The California Stewardship Fund tracks every one of them. Because the people closest to these decisions are the right ones to make them — and they deserve to know what's being taken from them.
